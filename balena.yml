  ## Introduction

  Screenconnect (formerly known as Copper-Clock OSE) is free digital signage software that is backed by our community and maintained by Copper-Clock, Inc.

  With Screenconnect, a monitor/TV and a Raspberry Pi, you can create a remotely managed screen that can display:

  * Images

  * Video

  * Web pages

  * Video feeds (RTSP)

  Thanks to Balena [OpenFleets](https://hub.balena.io/organizations/tccconnect_ose/fleets), you benefit from having automatic updates. As soon as updates are shipped, they will be deployed to your device.
